Java - programming language and a platform.
java is a highlevel language with the following characterist:
       It is simple
       object oriented
       distributed
       interpreted
       Robust
       Secure
       Architecture-neutral
       portable
       high performince
       multithreaded
       Dynamic
       
-Java program is both compiled and interpreted.
-With compiling, you transilate the java program into intermediate language called bytecodes.
-the bytecode is interpreted by the java interpretor.
N/b compilation occurs once while interpretation occur each time the program is executed.
-We can also say java bytecodes is a machine code instruction for java virtual machine.
-java program can be compiled into bytecode on any platform that has java compiler.
-Java platform has two components, and this are :
     -JM(The java virtual machine)
     -Java API (the java application programming interface.
-Java API is a large collection fo ready-made software components that provides useful capabilities such as:
       Graphical user interface(GUI) widgets
-Java API is grouped into  libraries(packages) of related components.
-Java is platform independent
-It is slow than the native code.
-Java applet is a java program that adheres to certain convention that allow it to run within a java enabled browser.
-server serves and supports clients on a network. Examples are:
      Web server
      proxy server.
      mail server.
      printer server.
      boot server.
      
-servlets are similar to applet in that they  are runtime extensions of applications .
-they run within the java server, configuring or tailoring the server.
-The core API is the API included in every full implementation  of the java platform.
-It gives the following features:
                 The essentials:objects, strings, threads, numbers, inputs, and outputs, data structures, system properties, data and time.
                 Applets: the sets of conventions used by java applets
                 networking is the tcp and UDP sockets and IP addresses.
                 internationalizations, helps in localising for users widewide.
                 security - both low level and high level including the electronic signature.
                 Software components - 
                 object serialization - allows lightweight persistence and communication via Remote method invocation(RMI)
                 java Database connectivity(JDBC) - provides uniform access to a wide range of relational databases.
-JVM and Java API insulates the java program from hardware dependancies.
-Why java  - Quick to start 
           - Less  code
           -better codes - ie encourages garbage collections that help avoid memory leaks.
           -program faster.
           
-Practical exercise:
       -Java file should have exact name as the class name.
       -compiling the the java source file, you exacute;
                javac filename.java
       -After successful compilation, a file name filename.class is create in the same directory. This class file contains the java bytecode-platform-independt codes
       interpreted by the java interpreter.
       -To run the application type:
            java filename.java
       -Your output will be displayed in the window where you invoked the interpreter.
       -Java methods(function-block of code) and variables should exist within a class.
       -The entry point of java application is the main method.
       -When you run application with class name, the interpreter invoke the main method in that class.
       -The main method control the flow of the program.
       -components of the java application are: objects, class, methods and java statements.
       
       
       Comments in java
       --------------------
       -/* text */ 
       -/** documentation */
       -//text
       
       Defining a class
       ---------------------
       -Is the besic building block of an object-oriented language.
       -It the blueprint  that describe the state and behavior associated with instances of that class.
       -Instanciating a class means that you create an object that has the same state and behaviors as other instances of he same  class.
       -state associated with  a class or object is stored in member variables.
       -The behavior  associated with a class or object is implemented with method.
       -Every java application must contain the main method:
               public static void main(String[] args){
                  //body of main method
                 }
      -The main method starts with three modifers
           -public - allows any class to call the main method
           -static - means that the main method is a class method
           -void - indicate that the main method does not return any value.
      -On invoking the java interpreter,you start by calling the class  main method, that will call other methods that will be required to run the application.
      -
      
      Arguments to the main method
      -------------------------------
      -While declaring the main method, you can pass arguments: an array of string for example:
            public static void main(String[] args)
      -This array is the mechanism through which the java VM passes information to your application.
      -Each string in the array is called a command-line argument.
        
        
       Using Classes and Objects
       --------------------------------
       -System class provides system independent access to system dependent functionality.
       -One feature provided by the system class is the standard output stream- a place to send text that usually  refers to the terminal  window in which you invoke 
       the java interpreter.
       -Standard output stream is used during the development cycle.
       
       Using a class variable
       ----------------------------
       Example:
           System.out.println("AM learning java")
       -The construct System.out is the full name of the out variable in the system class.
       -The application never instantiates the system class. Instead, it refers to out directly through the class.
       -This is because out  is a class variable -a variable  associated with a class rather than with an object.
       -The java allocates a class variable once per class , no matter how many instances of that class exist.
       -Class method implement class-specific bahavior.
       
       
       Applet
       ------
       -It facilitates the java program to be included in HTML pages and executed in java enabled browser.
       -To compile and run applet, you vsn use tools from the JDK
       -JDK compiler allows you to compile any kind of java program.
       -JDK applet viewer lets you run java applet.
       
       Creating java source file
       --------------------------
       -Create a file called LetUsAllLearnJava.java
         import java.applet.Applet;
         import java.awt.Graphics;
         public class LetUsAllLearnJava extends Applet{
           public void pain(Graphics g){
           g.drawString("Dudes i fkoech tell you to learn java" 30, 20);
           }
          }
