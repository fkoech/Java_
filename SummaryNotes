Java - programming language and a platform.
java is a highlevel language with the following characterist:
       It is simple
       object oriented
       distributed
       interpreted
       Robust
       Secure
       Architecture-neutral
       portable
       high performince
       multithreaded
       Dynamic
       
-Java program is both compiled and interpreted.
-With compiling, you transilate the java program into intermediate language called bytecodes.
-the bytecode is interpreted by the java interpretor.
N/b compilation occurs once while interpretation occur each time the program is executed.
-We can also say java bytecodes is a machine code instruction for java virtual machine.
-java program can be compiled into bytecode on any platform that has java compiler.
-Java platform has two components, and this are :
     -JM(The java virtual machine)
     -Java API (the java application programming interface.
-Java API is a large collection fo ready-made software components that provides useful capabilities such as:
       Graphical user interface(GUI) widgets
-Java API is grouped into  libraries(packages) of related components.
-Java is platform independent
-It is slow than the native code.
-Java applet is a java program that adheres to certain convention that allow it to run within a java enabled browser.
-server serves and supports clients on a network. Examples are:
      Web server
      proxy server.
      mail server.
      printer server.
      boot server.
      
-servlets are similar to applet in that they  are runtime extensions of applications .
-they run within the java server, configuring or tailoring the server.
-The core API is the API included in every full implementation  of the java platform.
-It gives the following features:
                 The essentials:objects, strings, threads, numbers, inputs, and outputs, data structures, system properties, data and time.
                 Applets: the sets of conventions used by java applets
                 networking is the tcp and UDP sockets and IP addresses.
                 internationalizations, helps in localising for users widewide.
                 security - both low level and high level including the electronic signature.
                 Software components - 
                 object serialization - allows lightweight persistence and communication via Remote method invocation(RMI)
                 java Database connectivity(JDBC) - provides uniform access to a wide range of relational databases.
