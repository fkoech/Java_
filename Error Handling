Will i was trying to do some simple debug and bulding a simple program in java complier in my terminal i encounter such error 
"""
System.out.println("I am learning java");
            ^
  symbol:   variable out
  location: class System
1 error
"""
Though it was a simple program like hello world, i got some headache,
What came to my attention is linter. So we are going to get some experience with linter.
For your information i normally use sublime text editor with vi editor in all programs that i develop.
so, what is linting?
we can define it as a process of checking your code for potential errors. This could be either 
syntax or the codee style.
